# Dash EDA Tool

Using [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash), I tried to build a tool in a short time that can, at a minimum, provide a few Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) functionalities and more!

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dash-eda-tool.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
